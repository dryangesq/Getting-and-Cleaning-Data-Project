Experiments description:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

For each record it is provided:
Each subject�s measurements on the mean and standard deviation based on the mentioned 6 actives. (79 variables)
The calculated average of each variable for each activity and each subject. (79 variables)
Units are as described in the experiments description above.

The dataset includes the following files:

- �code_book.txt'

- �README.txt'

- �tidy_data.txt�: Shows the measurements on the mean and standard deviation based on the mentioned 6 actives.

- �summary.txt': The calculated average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- �variable_names1.txt�: The complete list of variables of each feature vector in �tidy_data.txt�.

- �variable_names2.txt�: The complete list of variables of each feature vector in �summary.txt�.
